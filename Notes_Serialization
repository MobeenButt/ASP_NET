If we want to store objects in a file or send them over a network, we need to convert them into a format that can be easily saved or transmitted. This process is known as serialization.

Object -> Bytes -> Files -> Memeory-> Database


Serialization is conversion of object to byte stream
Deserialization is conversion of byte stream to object
