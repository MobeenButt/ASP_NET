HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that each request from a client to a server is treated as an independent transaction that is unrelated to any previous request. 

Example:

Add to cart button press request web server k pas aye gi then
jb response aye ga yani html render hogi in response to pervious state ka koi pata nhi chale ga isliya hm HTTP ko stateless protocol kehty hain.

State Management Techniques:
1.Cookies
2.Session state 
3.TempData
4.Query Strings
5.Hidden Fields
6.HttpContextItems
7.Cache

Cookies: 
1.Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the client-side (browser) that can be sent to the server with each request.

The Browser requests a web page from the server.
The server processes the request and sends back the web page along with a Set-Cookie header.
The browser stores the cookie and sends it back to the server with subsequent requests to the same domain.

Cookies store on the client side (computer hard drive)
