HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that each request from a client to a server is treated as an independent transaction that is unrelated to any previous request. 

Example:

Add to cart button press request web server k pas aye gi then
jb response aye ga yani html render hogi in response to pervious state ka koi pata nhi chale ga isliya hm HTTP ko stateless protocol kehty hain.
